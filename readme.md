# JavaScript Polyfills & Core Concepts Practice

This repository is my personal learning space for exploring how JavaScript works under the hood. It includes **polyfills** for native features and hands-on implementations of **core concepts** like debouncing and throttling.

## 📁 Structure

- `polyfills/` – Rewritten versions of native JavaScript methods
- `Some Core Concepts/` – Simple, practical examples of important JavaScript fundamentals

### Currently Implemented

#### ✅ Polyfills
- `Array.prototype.filter`
- `Array.prototype.flat`
- `Array.prototype.forEach`
- `Array.prototype.map`
- `Array.prototype.reduce`

#### 🧠 Core Concepts
- **Debouncing** – See: `Some Core Concepts/debounce_example`
- **Throttling** – See: `Some Core Concepts/throttle_example`

## 🎯 Goals

- Understand how native JavaScript methods work internally
- Reinforce my understanding of common JavaScript behaviors
- Build confidence writing logic from scratch without relying on built-ins

## 🔧 How to Run

Clone the repo and run any file using Node.js:

```bash
node polyfills/map.js
