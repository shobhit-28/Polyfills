# JavaScript Polyfills Practice

This repository is a personal collection of JavaScript polyfills that I've implemented to better understand how native JavaScript features work under the hood. Each polyfill is written from scratch, mimicking the behavior of native methods in environments that may not support them.

## 📁 Structure

Each file in the repo includes a standalone polyfill for a JavaScript feature or method. Examples and test cases are included to verify the behavior.

## ✅ Goals

- Deepen understanding of how core JavaScript features work.
- Improve problem-solving and low-level JavaScript skills.
- Build a reusable library of polyfills for reference or use.

## 🔧 How to Use

Clone the repository and run any file directly with Node:

```bash
node polyfills/map.js
